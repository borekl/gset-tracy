# Tracy's Gallery

Custom gallery set frontend. Can be seen in action
[here](https://tracy.zverinec.eu/). It relies on pre-generated
index of galleries and thumbnail images to represent them. The index generation
can be done with the `gset.pl` script, which is part of
[gallerizr](https://github.com/borekl/gallerizr). The thumbnail images size
is fixed at square aspect ratio and 128Ã—128 pixels at DPR=1.

File `index.html.example` contains minimal file needed for the gallery. You will
definitely want to do some additional styling to make it look reasonable!
